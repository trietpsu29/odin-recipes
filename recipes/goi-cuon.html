         <h2>Gỏi Cuốn Description</h2>
         <p>These fresh Vietnamese spring rolls are a refreshing change from the usual fried variety and have become a family favorite. They are a lovely, light appetizer and delicious dipped in one or both of the sauces included in this recipe. Great for parties as you can prep them ahead of time. 
            Spring rolls are appetizers that consist of a savory filling in a paper-thin wrapper made from flour and water. The exterior is so thin and crispy, it will shatter to the touch. Spring roll wrappers are thinner and more delicate than egg roll wrappers. 
            Vietnamese spring rolls (or gỏi cuốn) contain pork, shrimp, rice vermicelli noodles, and vegetables in a rice paper wrapper.

         <h2>How to Make Gỏi Cuốn</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 3 to 5 minutes; drain and set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Fill a large bowl with warm water. Dip one wrapper into the hot water for 1 second to soften.</li>
            <li>Lay wrapper flat; place 2 shrimp halves in a row across the center, add some cooled noodles, lettuce, mint, cilantro, and basil, leaving about 2 inches uncovered on each side.</li>
            <li>Fold uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with lettuce. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li>To make the chili sauce for dipping: Mix water, lime juice, sugar, fish sauce, garlic, and chili sauce in a small bowl until well combined.</li>
            <li>To make the second sauce for dipping: Mix hoisin sauce and peanuts in a separate small bowl.</li>
            <li>Serve spring rolls with the two sauce mixtures.</li>
